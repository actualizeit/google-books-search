# google-books-search

## Getting Started

This app lets you search for books using the google API and save books of interest to a database.

### How it Works

Type a search term into the main page and results will display below it. Click “Save” to add the listing to the database and to the “Saved” page accessible from the Navbar.

### Prerequisites

[It’s on Heroku](https://google-books-search-1.herokuapp.com/) so you good.

### Installing

See above.

## Built With

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - It’s free
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - You know you wanna run your code in the browser, don’t be coy
* [react](https://reactjs.org/) - loads page elements all like WICHAW!
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - dependencies for everyone! Even fun ones like:
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - take the express train to router errors
* [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - EZmongoDB
* [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - have my people call your people

Send your thoughts and prayers, I’m making a collection.

## Versioning
In the next version we will fuse the ionic wave shell or the entire transdimensional core could destabilize. We can’t forget to calibrate the transitory particle interceptor, or we could wind up with an unwelcome subharmonic oscillation. We also need to align the heuristic reflection manifold and interpolate http://www.scifiideas.com/technobabble-generator/
